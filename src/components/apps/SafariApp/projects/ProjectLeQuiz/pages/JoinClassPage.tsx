            Students can easily join classes by entering a class code
            shared by their teacher. This streamlined process ensures
            quick access to course materials and assignments.

            The join class feature provides a simple and secure way for
            students to become part of a learning community. Teachers can
            generate unique class codes that students can use to enroll,
            eliminating the need for complex registration processes.

            Once a student joins a class, they gain immediate access to all
            course content, assignments, and subject materials associated
            with that class.
