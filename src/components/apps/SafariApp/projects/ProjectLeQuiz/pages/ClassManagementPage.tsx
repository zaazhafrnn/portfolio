            Teachers can create and manage classes. Each class generates a
            unique class code that can be easily copied and shared with
            students, enabling quick class enrollment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The class management system provides teachers with full control
            over their learning environments. Teachers can create multiple
            classes, organize students, and manage class settings all from
            one central location.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unique class code system simplifies the enrollment process,
            allowing teachers to quickly add students to their classes
            without complex administrative procedures. Teachers can also
            view class rosters, manage student access, and track overall
            class performance.
