            Le Quiz was built to address the need for a comprehensive
            learning and assessment platform that works seamlessly across
            different devices. The project focuses on creating an interactive
            quiz system that functions similarly to a Learning Management
            System (LMS), enabling both students and teachers to engage with
            educational content efficiently.

            The motivation behind this project stemmed from the growing
            demand for flexible learning solutions that can adapt to various
            learning environments. Whether students are using mobile devices
            on the go or accessing the platform from desktop computers, Le
            Quiz provides a consistent and intuitive experience.

            This cross-platform approach ensures that educational content is
            accessible anytime, anywhere, making it easier for educators to
            manage their classes and for students to complete assignments and
            track their progress.
